# git-review

> **Note:** This is presently under active development and may not yet be useful generally.

This project aims to create an interactive CLI tool for reviewing git repositories on your local system and making it easy to do things such as:

- Delete old, unused, or fully-pushed repositories
- Become aware of any uncommitted code
- Become aware of unpushed code

At this point (2018-11-02) it is primarily for [my](https://github.com/zacharytamas) personal use but I expect it will be generally useful after I've refined it.
